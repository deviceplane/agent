# Deviceplane Agent

Deviceplane is an open source device management tool for embedded systems and edge computing. It solves various infrastructure problems related to remote device management such as:

- Network connectivity and SSH access
- Orchestration and deployment of remote updates
- Host and application monitoring
- Device organization: naming, labeling, searching, and filtering of devices
- Access and security controls

Deviceplane integrates with your device by running a lightweight static binary via your system supervisor. It can be used with nearly any Linux distro, which means you can continue using Ubuntu, Raspbian, a Yocto build, or whatever else fits your needs.

A hosted version of Deviceplane is available at [https://cloud.deviceplane.com/](https://cloud.deviceplane.com/).
